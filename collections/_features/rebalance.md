Beyond Melee is more than just additional characters, it’s a complete rework of Melee as a game in a variety of ways. Our goal for these changes is firstly for characters to be fun to play against, but also a balanced game which adheres strictly to the spirit of Melee- fast-paced, up-close, decision based combat. Many characters have more extreme changes than others to reach this goal, some so extreme that they haven’t been finished in time for Demo 1. Stay tuned for future releases.
