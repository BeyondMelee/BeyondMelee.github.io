You’ve seen Wolf before, and our Wolf is a greatest hits compilation of what you love most about this character. Not to mention, for his appearance in Beyond Melee, he has a totally original model. All of his specials work how you’d expect, but have slight tweaks here and there to align better with Beyond Melee’s balance and design guidelines. Let’s cover a couple unfamiliar bits first. Forward air and up air send at just the right angle and knockback to create a really interesting DI mixup tree, making tough decisions for both players. Down tilt is a sex kick launcher with a fresh animation. Dash attack’s animation is inspired by Ultimate Wolf. Bair is more of a swinging kick, with no lingering hitboxes, that sends at a low angle and hurts like hell to get hit by. Otherwise, he’s mostly what you’d expect. Players who loved Wolf in any of his other iterations will love him just as much in Beyond Melee.
