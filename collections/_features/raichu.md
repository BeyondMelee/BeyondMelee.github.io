Raichu isn’t just a Pikachu clone. Almost all of his moves are entirely new, but stay true to the spirit of the Pikachu lineage.
His neutral special is Electro Ball, a strong projectile that’s slow to come out, slow to travel across the stage, but if it hits you you’re likely to be combo’d to death... You’ll quickly see this is a pattern with this character.
At first, his Up Special will seem very similar to Pikachu’s, but under the hood it works much differently.. It has a longer startup, and only has a hitbox at the end of the zip. If you hit with this hitbox, you can cancel your up special into a jump, aerial, or airdodge.
Side special is similar to Pikachu’s in the air. On the ground, however, it becomes Volt Tackle. Raichu runs pretty slow normally, but he moves much faster during Volt Tackle. Storm across the screen to catch your opponents, chase after your electro ball, or jump cancel it to open up even more options. Fade back with a wavedash to trick your opponents, or jump in with a shocking surprise attack!
Down special is smaller than Pikachu’s thunder, but it packs a wallop. The storm cloud is a meteor, which sends opponents directly to Raichu for the explosive finisher!
His aerials are all entirely fresh, but draw inspiration from his previous evolutions.
Raichu is the slowest character in Beyond Melee, but with a great variety of unique tools at his disposal, Raichu is a complete package, and he packs a serious punch.
