The tricky terror of Termina wreaks his havoc on the Beyond Melee cast with his speed, and mischievous mix ups. His counter is actually a curse, planting a poisonous flower on his opponent's head, but the counterplay is what you’d expect... Except for one thing.
Skull Kid’s side special looks like his counter, but don’t be fooled! Try to punish it, and you’ll be hit away just before he teleports to safety. You’ll have to be ready for Skull kid’s tricks.
Being ready for Skull Kid will be hard, though. He’s fast, making an escape from his wrath difficult. He’ll control a ton of space by threatening with his float, which ends when he uses aerials.
Next, neutral special is a mine of darkness. Press B to spawn it, then throw it with A or the c stick. Tap the B button again to make it explode and set up for unique combos. Control space with your mine, making it all the more clear that nowhere is safe from Majora’s wrath.
Finally, his up special is a teleport that can move vertically up or down after a quick jump, allowing him to recover from well below the stage.
His smash attacks hold startling range for a character as small as him, reaching similar distances to Marth with his dangerous tendrils. Skull Kid’s up air and bair aren’t too out of the ordinary, except for the fact that they both turn him around in the air. Not only does he have a float, but you’ll need to be ready for any attack to come at you from any direction.
For the rest of his kit, every single move is extremely fresh. Nothing is borrowed. Everything is original, and everything inspires dread.
Skull Kid will take your stock, it’s only a matter of time.
