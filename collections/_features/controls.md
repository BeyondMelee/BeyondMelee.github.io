In local versus, push Dpad left on the character select screen to turn off tap jump. Push dpad left again to turn it back on. Push dpad right to toggle auto L cancel. In rollback online matches, hold dpad left until the announcer says “GO!” to turn off tap jump, or hold L to turn on ALC. To use both, simply hold both L and dpad left. The ALC and tap jump toggles are per-player, so if you don’t want to develop bad habits, but your opponent is more used to Ultimate or Project M, or just doesn’t want to break their hands, they can lighten the load for themselves. If a player has tap jump off or auto l cancel on, small indicators will appear on the hud below their percent. This way, even if the tournament takes place online, TOs can tell if a player has turned on ALC, and players will be able to tell if they’ve successfully activated the toggles.
