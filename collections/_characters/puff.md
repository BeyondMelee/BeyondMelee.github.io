## Changes to Jiggilypuff
![Jiggilypuff](/images/content/css/puff.png)

Melee’s balloon of nightmares has a handful of important tweaks, most notably an overhaul to rest. It has far less lag than vanilla, but also far less knockback. This makes it so that it kills at more normal percent ranges, but also doesn’t end your life on both hit and whiff.
Her pound can only be used once per jump, and her up b has been reworked to become healing song, healing both herself and her opponent. Both of these changes are to discourage any kind of stalling.
At the end of the day, it’s unclear if this version of Puff is more of a buff or nerf, and we’re excited to see what the answer is.
