## Changes to Roy
![roy](/images/content/css/roy.png)

Once a quirky marth imitator with few strengths to call his own, Roy now has a distinct identity. A new jab, down smash, improved dash attack, up tilt and forward tilt, and slightly quicker run speed make Roy really shine on the ground. His combo aerials have been retooled to consistently set up into more grounded action, and heâ€™s been given a new back air to finish the job in spectacular fashion. Roy is one of the most comboable characters in Melee, but now, he can trap his opponents in a soul-crushing punish vortex of his own.
