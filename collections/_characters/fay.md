name: Fay
over: Fay is a weapons specialist, lost in time. Though she’s only made an official appearance in the forgotten Star Fox 2, Fay feels both familiar and completely new. Her moveset is inspired by Fox from the original Super Smash Brothers, with tons of new twists. Most notably, her specials, like her sniper... The P.A.W.P. Fox, Falco, and Wolf all have iconic blasters, but they can’t hold a candle to the P.A.W.P. She isn’t always stuck with a slow sniper, though, she can switch to a weaker version of Falco’s laser. Hold B and A to swap between the pistol and the sniper! This swap is also useful for turning Fay around in the air. Her Shine is unique from the other spacies of the cast, sending neatly up and behind her to set up for interesting combo sequences. Fay’s up b is definitely the least flexible of the space animals’,as it’s only able to move straight up. However, you can charge it by holding B, allowing you to mix up your recovery distances. You might be thinking, wow, that recovery sucks. Nah. It’s bitchin. Side b is a recovery move, much like it is for other spacies, but this one is really, really different. Blast yourself with your own rocket back to the stage with this flexible yet extremely self punishing recovery option. Better get good at wall jump teching! It’s also a fun little projectile onstage, but using it in that way isn’t really a threat. Her side b isn’t the only place her missile launcher is used. Her up air, down air, and back air put the hefty weapon to good use, blasting opponents upwards and downwards, and launching them sideways with a powerful thwack. Fay isn’t your everyday spacie, but she’s still part of the Star Fox family, and you’ll feel that when you play her soon.
