## Changes to Peach
![peach](/images/content/css/peach.png)

Peach’s changes are largely about intentionality, which feeds into Beyond Melee’s removal of random mechanics. This means Peach is no longer ever inclined to camp to find a stitch. Peach always pulls a normal turnip now, except for when she’s done 300% with a moves through the course of a match. In practice, she gets roughly 1 stitch a game versus fast fallers, and sometimes 2 versus floaty characters. Oh, and her up tilt’s faster. This is fun!
