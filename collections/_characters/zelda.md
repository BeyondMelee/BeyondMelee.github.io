## Changes to Zelda
![zelda](/images/content/css/zelda.png)

Zelda’s kit has been reworked entirely. Instead of having only 4 useful moves, her entire kit is loaded with purpose. She has a new double kick down air and single hit combo nair that both set up into her devastating kill aerials. She’s quicker than you’d expect, too. With all of these new tools, Zelda is a character that demands respect and absolutely kicks ass.
