name: Meta Knight
over: Meta Knight flies in to Beyond Melee with a fresh moveset, bringing together a best-of of the character. His neutral b is a single hit kill move, his up b is a double whip that kills off the top, and his side and down b are as snappy as you could hope for. Finally, you can see if Meta Knight or Fox would win in Beyond Melee Demo 2!
