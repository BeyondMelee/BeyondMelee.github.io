name: Wolf
over: You’ve seen Wolf before, and our Wolf is a greatest hits compilation of what you love most about this character. Not to mention, for his appearance in Beyond Melee, he has a completely original model. All of his specials work how you’d expect, but have slight tweaks here and there to more perfectly align with Beyond Melee’s balance and design guidelines. Let’s cover a couple unfamiliar bits first. Forward air and up air send at just the right angle and knockback to create a really interesting DI mixup tree, making tough decisions for both players. Down tilt is a double kick launcher with a fresh animation. Dash attack is an in between of Melee Fox and Ultimate Wolf. Bair is more of a swinging kick, with no lingering hitboxes, that sends at a low angle and hurts like hell to get edgeguarded by. Otherwise, he’s mostly what you’d expect. Comfort food. Players who loved Wolf before from any game will love him just as much in Beyond Melee.
