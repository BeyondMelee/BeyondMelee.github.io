name: Skull Kid
over: The tricky terror of Termina wreaks his havoc on the Beyond Melee cast with his speed, and mischievous mix ups. His counter is actually a curse, planting a poisonous flower on his opponent's head, but the counter play is what you’d expect... Except for one thing. Skull Kid’s side special looks like his counter, but don’t be fooled! Try to punish it, and you’ll be hit away just before he teleports to safety. You’ll have to be ready for Skull kid’s tricks. Being ready for Skull Kid will be hard, though. He’s fast, making an escape from his wrath difficult. He’ll control a ton of space by threatening with his float, which ends when he uses aerials. Skull Kid will take your stock, it’s only a matter of time.
