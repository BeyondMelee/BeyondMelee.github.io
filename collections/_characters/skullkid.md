name: Skull Kid
over: Young link is the first character on this list who didn’t have many design flaws, or need as many new tools or buffs to help him succeed, so these lists will be a bit shorter from here on.. A new forward smash and forward air inspired by the jump slash from Ocarina of Time and Majora’s Mask! The end of the fair has a meteor effect, opening up both his combo and neutral game. Forward smash is a slower, heftier move that hits like a truck and grants Young Link 400 style points per hit. Up smash is now a single hit as well, helping him in anti-air situations.
