## Changes to Samus
![samus](/images/content/css/samus.png)

Samus is not really buffed or nerfed, just different. She’s been retuned for faster play with a more natural flow. She can now charge neutral b in the air. She’ll reach a full charge slightly quicker than Melee. Her up smash is also now a functional, beautiful move, that’s based on her parry from Samus Returns. Lastly, her bomb jumps are now limited to two per air time, which speeds up her recovery process for a more engaging experience for both players. These changes together may seem small, but in practice she’s very fresh.
