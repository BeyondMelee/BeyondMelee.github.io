name: Shadow Mewtwo
over: Shadow Mewtwo bursts into Beyond Melee with a diverse and unique moveset. He has similarities to Mewtwo in appearance, but in gameplay he couldn’t be more different. Even the way he moves around the stage feels totally new! Mega Evolution is making its first appearance in competitive Smash! Shadow Mewtwo’s signature mechanic is his ability to Mega Evolve. You can mega evolve with down b, once you’ve dealt 60% to your opponent via non-special) moves. Since watching meters while playing can be annoying, you’ll be able to tell he’s ready when he starts glowing purple. Mega Shadow Mewtwo deals more damage and knockback on all of his moves than his non-Mega form, and he moves faster as well. You remain in your mega form until you’ve whiffed attacks too many times. You can refill meter while mega evolved by landing more attacks, though, so if you want to keep the momentum in your favor, make smart plays. Mega evolution is great, but that’s not the only surprise up his sleeve. Shadow Mewtwo, ironically, has no Shadow Ball. Instead, press neutral b to activate Light Pillar. As you hold B, an indicator travels along the stage. Let go of B to activate the beam! It’s solid for both shield pressure and combos, however it’s quite slow to start up, and slow to cool down. It’s a commitment, but you can use this move to extend tech chases, combos, or to punish campy opponents! Next, he has a completely reworked up b. This up b is simple, but effective. It’s based on some of his moves from Pokken. He has less positional mixups than Mewtwo does with his teleport, but don’t let that fool you into thinking he can’t recover. Similar to Mario or Roy’s up special, this move travels quickly and sends out a flurry of hits to disorient opponents who don’t see it coming. For his normals, a stylish new back air with startling range allows Shadow Mewtwo to set up edgeguards, or finish them. He gets a new down tilt that’s slower to start and finish than Mewtwo’s, but it’s great at setting up into his scary aerial finishers… even scarier when he’s mega evolved. Based on his sword moves from Pokken, Shadow Mewtwo gets an ice cold up air to juggle opponents or send them to the stars. Up tilt gets the same treatment. A new upsmash more in line with his other two smash attacks, a fiery forward air that launches forward, a startlingly strong forward throw- and so many more unique aspects that set this character apart from Mewtwo. With all of these new moves, and mega evolution as the cherry on top, Shadow Mewtwo brings a lot of new concepts to the Melee landscape, which makes him a must-play in the BM roster.
