## Changes to Pikachu
![pikachu](/images/content/css/pikachu.png)

Pikachu’s bane has always been the floatier part of the cast, so to fill out his match up spread he has a new down throw that *actually* combos them. Honestly this was all he really needed, but we gave him some of what he didn’t know he wanted with a stronger back air, faster down b, and more damage on his up air.
