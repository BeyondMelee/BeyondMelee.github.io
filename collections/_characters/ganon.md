## Changes to Ganon

Captain Falcon’s wizard counterpart gets a lot of flak for his slow speed, so we’ve given sideb a little something to speed him up. If you land it in the air, you can cancel the attack into a jump, airdodge, or aerial. There’s a lot of creative and tricky ways to put this to use. He’s got a hugely powerful new upsmash, and his up tilt is now a grounded version of his iconic stomp. Top all that off with improvements to his attributes and neutral air, and you’ve got a wizard who’s worth your time.
