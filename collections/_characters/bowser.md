## Changes to Bowser
![Bowser](/images/content/css/bowser.png)

 Bowser is a sluggish brute of a character, but his first appearance in smash might have taken that idea a bit too far… We’ve made him quicker and smoother to move around with, but he’s still slow and hard hitting compared to the rest of the cast. He’s received a new down air, a slow, but explosively powerful meteor. To cap it off, his neutral B now launches a powerful fireball. To charge this fireball, you need to grab your opponent with sideb. This creates a good incentive for bowser to win neutral with up close, engaging, fast paced combat- while traditional charging methods like a passive timer encourages camping and more passive play until the charging is complete. When bowser gets his fireball by attacking you, as the opponent, you have an active role in whether bowser acquires this resource, just as bowser does. This kind of active player agency from both sides is something we try to encourage with all of our design choices, you’ll see a lot of changes made in service of this goal as we move forward.
