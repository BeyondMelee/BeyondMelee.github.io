## Changes to Sheik
![sheik](/images/content/css/sheik.png)

Sheik’s chain grabs are a problem in Melee, but when the list of viable characters Sheik can chaingrab goes from 1 to something like 30, it becomes a catastrophe. So, we changed it. Down throw and up throw are a DI mix up, but their knockback also scales less with percent than vanilla Sheik’s down throw. This means that in super high percent situations she can, if she guesses right, get a combo hit where she wouldn’t be able to in vanilla. The Goal was not to nerf or buff sheiks throws, but make them more exciting and DI-mixup based.
