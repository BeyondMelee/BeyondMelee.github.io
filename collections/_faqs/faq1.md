Q: Do I need to be a Patron to access Beyond Melee?

A: No, but a Patron gets access to access to exclusive sections of our Discord and the ability to playtest new characters during their development. If you would like to be to try those characters before their release, support us on our Patreon [here!](https://www.patreon.com/BeyondMelee)
