        How to install on Windows:
        1. Download Beyond Melee Offline Patcher v0.1.0
        2. Extract patcher exe and run it.
        3. Open Dolphin, the one you use for rollback/slippi(and make sure its up to date), and right click your vanilla Melee iso, then click “open containing folder”. See where your vanilla ISO is stored in your computer.
        4. Once you’ve found your Melee ISO, drag it anywhere on the patcher window.
        5. It will generate "BeyondMelee-[version_name]-1-0-0.iso" in the same folder as the patcher if everything went right.
        6. Put this iso in the same folder as your vanilla Melee iso, and then refresh Dolphin. Beyond Melee should show up as a separate ISO, no the vanilla one.
        You should be good to go. It should be compatible with unranked, direct, and doubles.
        If you still have any problems, make sure to first check the FAQ.
