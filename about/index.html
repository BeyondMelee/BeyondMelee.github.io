        <p>Beyond Melee is a rollback compatible game that sets out to take what you love about competitive Melee, and expand upon it with heaps of exciting new content. Over the past year and a half, we’ve created additional characters, stages, mechanics, and educated reimaginings of Melee’s original cast. Most importantly, though, Beyond Melee was created with the express purpose of carefully curating gameplay scenarios fit for tournament matches at every level of play, for years to come.</p>
