        <p>On the discord you can ask one of the developers for an application form, to which they will DM it to you. Fill it out, and we’ll consider putting you through the interview process.
Cheat code, the best way to get on the team ASAP is to show us that you can get things working in game as soon as possible, as that’s often the hardest part of developing the game!</p>
