FAQ:

Q: “Can I run my own Beyond Melee tournaments without your permission?”

A: YES, WE WOULD LOVE THAT!!

Q: “Can you post my tournament in the #tournaments channel in the Beyond Melee discord? Does it need to be online or in person?”

A: We will post either! Please [message us](https://beyondmelee.com/discord/) and we would love to help you set up.

Q: “Will smash.gg ever have Beyond Melee characters, rulesets, and stages programmed in?”

A: Yes, but only if the game gets popular enough and the demand of the scene meets the effort required of the smash.gg coding team.
The more tournaments are ran and the more stable the ruleset gets the more likely and more quickly the Smash.gg BM ruleset work gets through.

Q: “There are some weird stages listed as starters instead of a counter picks. Shouldn’t weirder stages be mostly counter picks and normal stages be starters?”

A: Not necessarily! While this mindset makes a lot of sense at a surface level, there’s no reason that as the set goes on the game needs to get more (or less) polarized, and there should be a variety of options at every step of the set. Many sets or players will end up on weirder stages, and many sets or players will play 5 games in a row on very normal stages. Spreading out the stage list like this lets everyone get more of what they want.

Q: “You can’t make all TO’s have the same ruleset!”

A: True! We can’t make anyone do anything.
But there’s a few important things to note:

1. No Smash game or mod has ever had a recommended ruleset, not even Project M/+ ever had an official ruleset.
2. Stagelists and rulesets HEAVILY affect game balance. For example, even swapping out FD and PS in Melee as starters/counter picks instantly changed major aspects of the meta over night.
3. Beyond Melee will be actively updating for a long time, and any issues with our stages, rulesets, characters, and more have opportunities to change over time.

With all this in mind, we will be pushing hard for a unified ruleset for ALL events to follow.
Players want to practice on rulesets that they know will transfer to other events, otherwise the practice isn’t quite as valuable and brings feelings of instability and wasted efforts.
In the Beyond Melee discord there is a channel for TO’s. There we will continue to very actively discuss everything relating to this kind of discussion.

Q: “What if someone just wants to run an event without your ruleset?”

A: Beyond Melee is still just a game we drop in to the world. We cant do anything about it, and, honestly, we’re fine with it. It just makes our jobs a lot harder in the long run.
Tournaments that run these alternative rulesets will give back less valuable feedback on character balance, stage balance, and more, and that’s feedback we always want to hear.

Q: “How come at some events the Melee top tiers are banned? That’s really exclusionary. I just want to play my main in this cool game!”

A: There’s a couple reasons this happens.
Many players enter Beyond Melee events because players want a change of pace, and when that change of pace ends up being playing as or against what you play at every other event it’s a bit of a bummer.
On the topic of variety, if you are trying as hard as you can to win in Beyond Melee and Melee top tiers are allowed, you’ll feel an urge to swap to your Melee top tier main, and then your opponent might as well. Many times in Beyond Melee events have both opponents started as their Beyond Melee main and ended the set in Melee top tier matches, which isn’t really why those players are here.
When a Beyond Melee tournament bracket is specifically a side event or, what’s happening now, a BMvitational qualifier it’s important that Melee players who have never played Beyond Melee wont swoop in, win with their Melee main, and then dip. While this may not seem like a huge issue, it often defeats the purpose of these brackets and events. In the case of BMVitational qualifier spots, it’s very important to make sure the players who make it in are in it for Beyond Melee, not just some quick Melee money.
This stuff comes off as exclusionary, I get it, but often times these bans happen just to add more spice or test different skills than what everyone’s used to being tested on. It’s also very possible that as the meta grows, characters get buffed, and the culture changes that in the future there will be no events with Melee top tiers banned.

Q: “Why character first and stage second? Melee and Ult aren’t like that.”

A: After years of playtesting and research, it’s an idea that Project M/+ came up with, and we think it’s great. While it feels odd at first, it offers MUCH more power to the counterpicker, whereas stage first offers much more power to the previous games winner. Being able to take characters to stages they don't like rather than what happens in stage first, which is picking a stage, then your opponent picking a character that’s great on that stage... It just makes the match a lot more dynamic and less frustrating.
Character first is a major nerf to Mew2King types and will make sets overall reach game 5 much more often, which we think is great!

Q: “What is DSR?”

A: https://www.ssbwiki.com/Dave%27s_Stupid_Rule

Q: “Why no DSR?”

A: We hear you, but no DSR makes sets much less predictable and leads to less of a feeling of being “trapped” on a stage you don't like, even as the counter picker, later in to the set. No DSR, in combination with our large number of bans(3) lets both players express a lot more decision making and freedom through the set while also letting players be able to ban stages that feel the worst to them.

Q: “What about Auto L Cancel(ALC) and Tap jump toggle. Should those be allowed?”

A: Tap jump toggle should always be allowed at every level of play for everyone, no question.
ALC is a different discussion.
ALC is a massive, massive tool in helping grow the game, the scene, and community. Allowing some form of ALC at tournaments is the difference between so many Ult kids trying Melee/Beyond Melee for the first time and possibly sticking with it for a long, long time.
L canceling is a skill that’s important and extremely satisfying to learn, but it shouldn’t be so much of a barrier that it doesn’t allow players to even try out the game casually at an event.
So.
ALC should be allowed up until the set right before money is paid out. This means that if top 3 of a bracket gets paid out, winners semis and losers semis both ban ALC, but all sets before that keep it legal.
This is a really complex solution but accomplishes a couple important goals.
It allows new players to try the game, it’s not like they expect to make that far in to bracket anyway, which is totally fine!
Existing skilled Melee/PM players wont have that feeling of “I should just keep ALC on always then lol, even tho it will mess up my muscle memory it’s just optimal” because it simply wont be, due to needing to L cancel again later in bracket if they want to make any money.

Remember that players who go 0-2 and 1-2 make up half of every tournament bracket and thus the final total pot. The more 0-2ers and 1-2ers you have the better, I promise.
